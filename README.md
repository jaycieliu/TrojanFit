# TrojanFit
**AI Wellness & Fitness Community App Prototype (Case Competition)**

TrojanFit is an **AI-enabled wellness and fitness networking app prototype** designed to help students discover activities, coordinate with peers, and take action under real schedule constraints.

Instead of treating wellness as a content problem, TrojanFit focuses on **activation** — reducing the friction between *wanting to be active* and *actually joining an activity*.

## Project Snapshot

- **Type:** AI product / case competition / prototype
- **Focus:** AI personalization + social activation + schedule-aware recommendations
- **Artifacts:** Figma prototype, case slides, survey-based user research
- **Target Users:** USC students (initial concept tested with USC MSBA cohort)

## Overview

TrojanFit is a **community and AI-driven fitness platform** that combines:

- **Personalized event discovery**
- **Schedule-aware recommendations**
- **Social coordination and accountability**
- **Campus-centered wellness engagement**

The goal is to make wellness participation more **actionable, social, and sustainable** — not just informative.

---

## Why This Opportunity Exists (User Research)

We conducted a survey with **USC MSBA students (N=46)** to understand barriers to wellness and fitness engagement.

### Key Insights
- **83%** reported barriers related to **time and energy**
- **Average stress level = 4/5** (High / Very High)
- **55%** reported stronger activation when they had **social partners**
- Students responded positively to the idea of an **AI + community-driven** wellness platform

> **Design implication:** TrojanFit was framed not as another tracker, but as an **activation system** that combines AI recommendations with social and scheduling support.

## Product Concept

TrojanFit helps students:

- **Discover** relevant activities and events
- **Get recommendations** based on preferences and schedule
- **Coordinate** with peers for accountability
- **Act quickly** with less planning friction

### Core Product Thesis
TrojanFit uses AI as a **workflow layer** to support decision-making and follow-through — not just as a chatbot feature.

## Core Features (Prototype Scope)


### 1) Onboarding & Personalization

Builds the personalization foundation by collecting user context:
- USC sign-in and profile setup
- Interests and skill levels (e.g., Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
- Professional / demographic inputs (optional)
- Calendar sync entry point

### 2) Intelligent Home Feed
A personalized “mission control” feed designed to reduce search effort and increase action.
- Trending and nearby activities
- Personalized recommendations
- Category filters (e.g., basketball, tennis, yoga)
- Fast event cards with quick decision cues

---

### 3) AI Recommendations + Calendar Integration
TrojanFit uses availability and preferences to recommend activities that fit the user’s real schedule.
- Weekly planning interface
- Availability-aware activity suggestions
- Calendar sync to reduce scheduling friction
- Agenda visibility to support follow-through

---

### 4) AI-Powered Search
Natural-language search helps users discover activities more efficiently.
- Query-based event discovery
- Contextual search intent (e.g., activity type, time, location)
- Reduced planning friction through faster filtering

---

### 5) Interactive Map Experience
Map-based exploration supports location-aware discovery and quick action.
- Nearby events displayed as pins
- Clickable event details and previews
- Navigation-friendly event exploration
- Integration of fitness + networking opportunities

---

### 6) Social Layer: Event Setup, Groups, and Chat
TrojanFit includes a social coordination layer to improve accountability and retention.
- Create sports or networking events
- Manage event details (time, venue, participants)
- Profile and group chat features
- Event history, skill level visibility, and participation status

---

## AI Product Logic (How AI Creates Value)

TrojanFit uses AI as a **decision-support and activation layer** across the user workflow.

### High-Level AI Flow
1. **Collect user signals**  
   (profile, skill level, preferences, availability)
2. **Interpret context**  
   (time constraints, activity type, schedule fit)
3. **Generate recommendations**  
   (events / activities likely to be relevant and actionable)
4. **Present options through product surfaces**  
   (feed, search, map, calendar)
5. **Support follow-through**  
   (social connection, event setup, chat, reminders)

> This design combines **personalization + behavioral activation + social accountability**.

---

## Competitive Positioning

TrojanFit sits between:
- **Fitness-focused platforms** (tracking / classes / training)
- **Social/community platforms** (connection without wellness-specific activation logic)

### Differentiation
- **Fitness + networking** in one experience
- **Trojan/USC-centered community focus**
- **AI-powered scheduling and recommendation workflow**
- **Action-first design** (reduce planning friction, increase participation)
