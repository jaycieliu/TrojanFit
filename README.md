# TrojanFit: AI Wellness App Prototype (Case Competition)

## Overview
TrojanFit is an AI-enabled wellness and fitness networking app prototype designed for students. The project was developed as a case competition concept and combines **user research**, **AI-assisted personalization**, and **community-based activation** to improve wellness engagement.

Rather than framing wellness as a content problem alone, TrojanFit focuses on **activation**: helping students discover relevant activities, coordinate with others, and take action within real scheduling constraints.

## Why this opportunity exists (User Research)
We conducted a survey with **USC MSBA students (N=46)** to understand student wellness and fitness barriers.

Key insights from the survey:
- **83%** reported barriers related to **time and energy**
- **Average stress level = 4/5 (High / Very High)**
- **55%** reported being more activated with **social partners**
- TrojanFit was framed as a **community and AI-driven fitness platform** with personalized experience design

These findings shaped the product direction: combine **AI personalization** with **social + scheduling support** rather than building just another fitness tracker.

## Product Concept
TrojanFit is a **community and AI-driven fitness platform** that helps students:
- discover activities and events
- get recommendations based on schedule and preferences
- coordinate with peers
- take action with less planning friction

The design goal is to make wellness engagement more actionable, social, and sustainable.

## Core Features (Prototype Scope)

### 1) App Onboarding & Personalization
- Collects personal / demographic / professional information
- Captures fitness skill level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
- Builds a personalized experience foundation

### 2) Intelligent Home Feed
- Real-time discovery of trending activities
- Personalized feed designed to reduce searching and increase action
- “Mission control” style home screen for fast decision-making

### 3) AI Recommendations & Calendar Integration
- AI-powered event recommendations tailored to the user’s schedule
- Calendar sync with external calendars + TrojanFit events
- Smart availability check to reduce scheduling friction

### 4) AI-Powered Search
- Natural-language search for events / activities
- Contextual query understanding for easier discovery

### 5) Interactive Map
- Nearby events and locations displayed on an interactive map
- Clickable event details and navigation support
- Fitness + networking event discovery in one experience

### 6) Event Setup & Social Layer
- Create **networking** or **sports** events
- Event inputs include date/time, venue proximity, and attendees
- Profile and chat features for event groups / individuals
- Event history, skill level, and status tracking

## AI Product Logic (How AI creates value)
TrojanFit uses AI as a **workflow layer**, not just a chatbot feature.

High-level decision flow:
1. Collect user signals (profile, skill level, preferences, calendar availability)
2. Interpret context (time constraints, activity type, schedule fit)
3. Recommend relevant events / activities
4. Present actions through feed + map + search
5. Support follow-through via social connection, event setup, and chat

This design combines personalization with behavioral activation and social accountability.

## Competitive Positioning
The project positions TrojanFit in the gap between:
- fitness-focused platforms (tracking / training / classes)
- social/community platforms

TrojanFit’s differentiator is the **combination** of:
- fitness + networking
- Trojan-centric community focus
- AI-powered scheduling and recommendation flows

## GTM / Business Thinking
The project also includes early go-to-market and business model thinking:

### Launch strategy (phased)
- **Pre-launch:** recruit seed users and run beta testing
- **Official launch:** drive adoption in the MSBA community
- **Expansion:** improve product using feedback and expand partnerships

### Channels (examples)
- social media / influencer-led student promotion
- MSBA email loop
- on-campus flyers and events
- club and campus partnerships

### Business model (early concept)
- B2B sponsorship
- Event host commission fees

## Success Metrics (KPI Framework)
The project defines product metrics across the funnel:

### User Acquisition
- Download rate
- Number of completed profiles

### Activation & Engagement
- Number of buddy matches made
- Number of events created / joined
- Daily Active Users (DAU)

### Retention
- Weekly / monthly retention rate
